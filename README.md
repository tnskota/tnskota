Hi, I'm tns! I specialize in creating insightful data visualizations and dashboards, particularly using Power BI. Recently, I developed interactive dashboards for a banking project, where I analyzed customer data, loan details, and trends over time. My work involved visualizing loan statuses, customer demographics, and monthly debt trends, which greatly enhanced decision-making and strategic planning.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Analyzed loan status distribution and compared average annual income.
Visualized monthly debt trends and calculated total current credit balance.
Enabled focused analysis through calendar quarter filters.
Passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and decisions. Always eager to collaborate on open-source projects, AI research, and innovative web development initiatives.
